## ðŸ’­ Reflections ðŸ’­
All in all this project was really hard for me to start working on. I struggled alot with getting inspired to even begin. However half-way through the week I managed to pull myself together and get cracking!

Once production had begun it was easy to get everything running. Also, I actually managed to create a custom hook for the fetch request function! ðŸ˜ƒ So happy about this!
<br><br>
Issues that came up:
- My main issue (apart from lack of inspo.) was to get structure the project in a sensible way. I knew what paths I needed but since my design ideas changed throughout the week I struggled with making useful components. But I managed to solve this eventually as my design got clearer.


If I were to continue on this project / start over I would:
- Add more lists
- Work on the responsiveness more
- Look over my structure for components, try to find ways to minimize the amount of imports I have.
